Objective of the game:
Destroy the bricks to get the highest score within the lives. Have fun ðŸ˜Š

Important keys you should know!
 A - Move paddle to the left.
D - Move paddle to the right.
ALT - Open the debug menu.
SPACE - pause the game.
ESCAPE - Open Pause menu.
MOUSE- To select on screen buttons.

Additions:
-	Now the paddle can move from one end of the screen to the other increasing mobility to counter the speed of the ball.
-	The ball gradually increases in speed as time goes on in the game.
-	When the ball makes contact it changes its speed as well to mimic momentum.
-	I have added an additional level to ramp up the difficulty.
-	I have added a high score board in the game which prompts the user to enter their name upon achieving a high score.
-	I have added an info button in the start menu to explain how to play the game.
-	When the ball hits the center of the brick, the paddle slightly increases in size.
-	When the ball hits the center of the paddle, it also slightly increases in size.
-	When the ball doesnâ€™t hit the center of either the brick or the paddle, the size of the paddle decreases.
-	I have added another button to go to the previous level. Note that changing levels using the debug is considered cheating hence your score is back to 0.
Refactoring:
-	I have converted the entire project into java fx.
-	I have added a new class called collision tool to make the code easier to understand.
-	I have used model view control for my game.
-	I have encapsulated the data to keep it as private as possible.
-	I have done proper documentation such as Javadoc.
-	I have converted the project to maven.
-	I have done Junit testing to make sure there are no errors.
-	I have organized my work into each respective packages. 
-	I have made that all my bricks work on probability of breaking.
